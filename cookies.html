                <h1>Cookies Information</h1>
                <p>
                    When you use our websites, information linked to the browsing activity carried out
                    using your internet access device (PC/laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.) may be
                    recorded in "cookie" files that get stored on your device. You can choose whether
                    to allow the use of these cookies or not and can modify the choices you make at any
                    time.
                    What is a cookie?
                    The term "cookie" is used to refer to multiple technologies (cookies, tags, pixels,
                    Javascript code, etc.) that can be used to track browsing activity or analyze the
                    behavior of a website visitor. These technologies are constantly being developed
                    and updated.
                    A cookie is a small text file saved by your PC's/laptop's, tablet's or smartphone's
                    web browser and which enables user data to be stored for the purposes of
                    facilitating the browsing experience and enabling the use of particular features.
                    There are two kinds of cookies used on our websites:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First-party cookies, which are placed on your device by Vida & Partners Digital and
                        used by our websites for browsing and functionality purposes;</li>
                    <li>Third-party cookies, which are placed on your device by third-party partner
                        organizations for the purposes of identifying your areas of interest and
                        sending you personalized offers.These third-party cookies are managed
                        directly by the organizations that generate and maintain them, and who are
                        also required to conform with data protection legislation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>What are the cookies generated by our website used
                    for?
                    Vida & Partners Digital generates different types of cookies, the purposes of which are
                    described below.
                    <h2>Feature Cookies</h2>
                    These cookies are essential to the process of browsing our websites, making it
                    possible, in particular:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To store information collected from you via forms you complete (account
                        creation and account access, subscription services, shopping cart contents,
                        etc.);</li>
                    <li>
                        To enable you to access areas of our websites reserved for you personally –
                        such as your personal account space – via the use of account identifiers;</li>
                    <li>
                        To implement security measures, such as when you are requested to log on to
                        your account again after a certain period of time.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Analytical and audience measurement cookies</h2>
                <p>These cookies enable us to compile statistics and monitor the numbers of visitors
                    using our websites and services so that we can improve both them and the
                    experience you have as a user of our sites. In order to achieve this, we use
                    audience measurement cookies, and in particular, Google Analytics.
                    Personalization of advertisements based on your areas of interest
                    We try hard to show you those offers and ads that are most relevant to you, and
                    we do this by using ad cookies that make it possible to display to you, in real time,
                    content that most closely matches your areas of interest, as deduced from your
                    recent browsing activity.</p>
                <h2>Personalization of the user experience</h2>
                <p>These personalization cookies enable us to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adapt the presentation and appearance of our website to the particular
                        internet access device used;</li>
                    <li>
                        Adapt the presentation and appearance of our websites to the preferences
                        of each individual user. In particular, Vida & Partners Digital uses A/B testing, which
                        makes use of cookies, in order to personalize content and provide variant
                        versions of our sites. Though these cookies are not essential, they do enable
                        you to browse our websites more smoothly and fluidly, and this applies no
                        matter what device you are using.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Most of these cookies expire at the end of your visit to our sites. Others have a
                    longer lifespan, though this never exceeds 13 months, which is in compliance with
                    current legislation.
                    An exhaustive list of the kinds of cookies that may be stored on your terminal is
                    available here.</p>
                <h2>Accepting or blocking cookies</h2>
                <p>There are several options available to you where managing cookies is concerned. Any
                    changes you make to your settings (with respect to allowing or blocking cookies) are
                    likely to affect your browsing of our websites and your access to certain services
                    requiring the use of these cookies.
                    If you choose to prevent cookies being stored on your device, or if you remove
                    those that have already been stored, we cannot be held responsible for any
                    consequences this may have with respect to any reduced functionality of our
                    services resulting from our inability to store or access the cookies necessary for
                    their functioning.
                    You can choose to set or modify your preferences with respect to cookies at any
                    time using the methods described below.
                    Via your web browser settings
                    You can choose to deactivate cookies at any time. Your browser can also be set to
                    alert you when cookies are stored on your device and ask you whether you want to
                    accept them or not. You can either accept or block cookies on a case-by-case by
                    basis or set your browser to automatically refuse them by default.
                    Please bear in mind that changing your settings may alter your access to those of
                    our services that require the use of cookies.
                    If your browser is set to block all cookies, you will not be able to make purchases or
                    use essential features of our website (e.g. add items to your shopping cart). In
                    order to manage cookies in a way that matches your requirements as closely as
                    possible, we recommend you take into account the purposes for which cookies are
                    used, as described above, when altering your browser settings.
                    Each browser is different where managing cookies and setting your options is
                    concerned. The procedure will be described in your browser's help menu, where you
                    will be able to find out how to change your settings to match your preferences.</p>

                    Internet Explorer does not allow you to manage cookies individually. To remove all
                    your cookies:</p>

                    <h2>Private browsing</h2>
                    The "Private browsing" offered today by all browsers allows you, in particular, to
                    browse anonymously, i.e. without the history of the pages you've visited and your
                    downloads being saved. Where cookies are concerned, any that are stored during
                    your browsing are removed when you close your browser. This does not amount to a
                    way of blocking cookies therefore, but their lifetime is limited to the length of
                    time you spend browsing.
                    Deactivating third-party cookies
                    By deactivating third-party cookies, you can block all cookies except those
                    generated by Vida & Partners Digital. Here are the procedures to follow in the various
                    browsers if you want to block third-party cookies:
