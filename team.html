							<p>Kelli has over 8 years of experience in customer service. During the latter half of that
								time she obtained a BS in Kinesiology. After graduating in 2015, Kelli worked as an

								years before her move to the West Coast. With her strong background in case management
								and client relations, Kelli is our liaison for communications with clients and the
								digital marketing team. After
								years of working for doctors as an office administrator, she knows how easy it is for
								meaning to get lost in conversation, not to mention chicken scratch! Kelli’s goal is
								clear communication, timely service, and delivered expectations.
								<br />
								<br />
								When she's not working, Kelli enjoys fine wine and appreciating the artwork of Antonio
								Segura Donat.
